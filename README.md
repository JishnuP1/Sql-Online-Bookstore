# Sql-Online-Bookstore
This script is designed to manage and analyze data for an Online Bookstore. It includes the creation of a database and retrieval of insights from three key tables: Books, Customers, and Orders. After importing the data, the script performs a series of 20 SQL queries to answer common business questions, such as:

Listing books by genre, price, and publication year.

Identifying customer and order trends (e.g., customers from Canada, frequent buyers, high-spending customers).

Analyzing inventory (e.g., total stock, books with lowest stock, stock remaining after sales).

Generating sales metrics (e.g., total revenue, books sold per genre/author, top-selling books).

Finding patterns in orders by date, quantity, and total amount.

Ranking books and customers based on price, quantity, and spending.

These queries help provide insights for decision-making regarding inventory, customer behavior, and overall store performance.
